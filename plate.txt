me:  So, architecture;
there is our beloved main()
 Sent at 6:34 PM on Wednesday
 me:  it basically, creates a Window, and instantiates a Game object
and it pipes all currently pending event notifications from the window, and the network, into the Game object.
 Sent at 6:36 PM on Wednesday
 me:  Now, the thing about a game, or, any program really, is that there are distinct phases in the execution paths, during the life cycle of it..i guess that's over complicating it with words, but the concept is birthed from TankGame's need for a 'Start menu' phase, a 'Lobby' phase, and the 'Actual game' phase.
So, i created the notion of a 'Stage'
and it is illustrated in the code(that i have not pushed) GameStage.h
 Sent at 6:40 PM on Wednesday
 me:  So, the arch-overlord of everything is the TankGame class. it can cycle through the different stages of a game without caring what the stage does. This is done by implementing a stage in a class that inherits from the GameStage class.
TankGame has 3 stages
(i was calling them phase for a sec)
 Sent at 6:43 PM on Wednesday
 me:  they are implemented by the classes 'StartPopup', 'LobbyPopup', 'Game'
that's all i got for now 
 Sent at 6:44 PM on Wednesday
 me:  For networking, I have defined the following Messages:
WhoIs,
       WhoIsAck,
       Id,
       IdAck,
       IdNack,
       Ready,
       Start,
       Action,
       State
 Sent at 7:24 PM on Wednesday
 me:  Ok, so main()
or....ServerMain() and ClientMain()
both are of the same basic structure as the main() you have already studied.
 Sent at 8:00 PM on Wednesday
 me:  The differences between ServerMain and ClientMain are that ServerMain spends most of it's time processing incoming network messages. ClientMain spends most of its time in processing local input, receiving network  data necessary to draw everything, and watching timers
both have the doLoop()
 Sent at 8:03 PM on Wednesday
 me:  doLoop is takes the current state of the game, multiplies it by the current input, and then spits something out that looks like the next state.
it is necessary, because network and local input only execute if there are events to be processed.
where as doLoop, executes every frame
so, doLoop is a good place to watch timers expire so that you can animate, and stuff.
or, in the case of the Server, doLoop will take everything it has recieved from all the players, compute the next state of the game, and transmit that state to each player.
going back to the networking messages i defined..
normal game play will see Action messages spewing out from the players towards the server.
The Action message contains data that indicates either a control action, or an attack action.
So, the Action message is how the client tells the server that it did something.
 Sent at 8:09 PM on Wednesday
 me:  the doLoop will actually be using these incoming Action messages to construct a State message. So the client doesn't do any computation, it is completely dumb. it just draws pretty stufff
i've probably been confusing on when i'm talking about the Server, and when i am talking about the Client.
but, i should be putting this in a document.
